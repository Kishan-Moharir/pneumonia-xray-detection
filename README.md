# Pneumonia Disease Detection
This project focuses on detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques.  
It was developed as an academic and learning project to understand medical image classification.

## Project Overview
Pneumonia is a lung infection that can be identified through chest X-ray images.  
In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is used to classify X-ray images as **Pneumonia** or **Normal**.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Dataset
- Chest X-ray image dataset
- Images categorized into:
  - Pneumonia
  - Normal
- Dataset sourced from publicly available medical datasets

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and image resizing  
- Splitting dataset into training and testing sets  
- Building a CNN model for image classification  
- Training the model on chest X-ray images  
- Evaluating performance using accuracy and loss  

## Results
- The model was able to learn distinguishing features from chest X-ray images  
- Achieved reasonable accuracy for a beginner-level deep learning project  
- Performance visualized using training and validation graphs  

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of CNN architecture  
- Hands-on experience with medical image data  
- Experience with model training, evaluation, and visualization  
- Improved understanding of deep learning workflows  

## Future Improvements
- Improve accuracy using data augmentation  
- Try transfer learning models such as VGG16 or ResNet  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Deployment using a simple web interface  

## Status
This project is part of ongoing learning and can be improved further.
